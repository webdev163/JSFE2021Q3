        <p class="explore-text">Las Meninas is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish
          Golden Age.</p>
        <p class="explore-text">It was cleaned in 1984 to remove a <span>"yellow veil"</span> of dust that had gathered
          since the previous restoration in the 19th century.</p>
        <p class="explore-text">The cleaning provoked furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any
          way, but because it looked
          different.</p>
